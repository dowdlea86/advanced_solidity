# Advanced Solidity

Creating a deploying a crowdsale for a token called Pupper Coin to help fund development<br>
of the network.  The goal is to raise a maximum of 300 Ether.  If the goal is met, we will<br>
write in a refund function.  The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.<br>

We will write our code in Remix and have attached the relevant code files in the repo.<br>
We will bootstrap the contract by inheriting 5 OpenZeppelin contracts:
CrowdSale
MintedCrowdSale
CappedCrowdSale
TimedCrowdSale
RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale

We will then need to provide parameters for all the features of our crowdsale such that<br>
we will need to accomplish our crowdsale.  We will need to include the following paramters.<br>
Name of the crowd sale, the symbol we will use, the wallet address, the rate (worth) of the token<br>
which in this case we will set to 1.


and for fundraining our goal of 300 ether.  However, becuase we cannot use faucets for such a<br>
large amount of ether.  We will use a smaller number as a target funding.<br>
